The most simple setup just creates a volume and a network and starts the docker.gitea.com/gitea:latest-rootless image as a service. Since there is no database available, one can be initialized using SQLite3.

Create a directory for data and config:

mkdir -p gitea/{data,config}
cd gitea
touch docker-compose.yml

Then paste the following content into a file named docker-compose.yml:

version: "2"

services:
  server:
    image: docker.gitea.com/gitea:1.23.8-rootless
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/lib/gitea
      - ./config:/etc/gitea
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "2222:2222"

Note that the volume should be owned by the user/group with the UID/GID specified in the config file. By default Gitea in docker will use uid:1000 gid:1000. If needed you can set ownership on those folders with the command:

sudo chown 1000:1000 config/ data/

    If you don't give the volume correct permissions, the container may not start.

For a stable release you could use :latest-rootless, :1-rootless or specify a certain release like :1.23.8-rootless, but if you'd like to use the latest development version then :nightly-rootless would be an appropriate tag. If you'd like to run the latest commit from a release branch you can use the :1.x-nightly-rootless tag, where x is the minor version of Gitea. (e.g. :1.16-nightly-rootless)


docker-compose up -d
